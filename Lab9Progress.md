### "TABle 5" Project Progress

Our group is implementing a Google Chromium extension that replaces the standard "New Tab" interface of Chrome with a personalized and interactive "dashboard".

The extension is implemented using the MeteorJS engine.  Since none of us had prior knowledge of JavaScript, all of us started doing crash courses using W3Schools and Codeacademy, two online resources that supply information for learning and referencing the fundamentals of JS.

We managed to find several other open source "New Tab" modifications on github, and plan to use them for guidance while learning how to implement such methodology in MeteorJS.

So far, we have a structured project directory on a local computer (we haven't uploaded it remotely yet).  The directory contains a "main" file as well as images and other graphics that the extension will use.  We also have a manifest file, which provides metadata regarding the extension when a user installs it to his/her browser.
