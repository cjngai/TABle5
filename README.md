# TABle5

## Introduction

Welcome to the TABle5 repository.  TABle5 is an extension for Google Chrome that allows you to customize the browser's "New Tab" page into your own personal homepage.

All you need to use TABle5 is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) itself! The extension is written in Javascript, which is natively supported by the browser.

## Installing TABle5

## Customizing TABle5

When you open a new tab on Chrome, you will be greeted by your new homepage.  To customize certain features, click the **Settings** menu in the bottom left corner of the page.

### Background Settings

If the default background does not fit your style, you have the option of changing it.
You may either upload your own background photo, or simply change the background to a solid color.

### Game of Life

You can toggle an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) to run in the background.  In order to save CPU cycles, the game will pause when the tab or active window is switched.
